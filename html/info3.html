<b><font size=30>Feature requests/collaboration</font></b><br>
If you would like a new feature added to gpvdm and would like to collaborate to produce a paper together, just drop me an e-mail.  In principle, I'm happy to add any feature.  Features which I would like to add but canâ€™t justify as there is no immediate route to publication are:
<ul>
  <li>Improved perovskite models, which include ion diffusion.</li>
  <li>Improved OLED models: I have not used the OLED model my self, so I think there is a lot which could be added to it. Including far/near field calculations.</li>
  <li>The inclusion of thermal models.  There is a thermal model in the model but I have not really used it much.</li>
  <li>Integrated FDTD optical model.</li>
  <li>Better fitting with experimental data.</li>
  <li>Improved OFET models.  As with the OLED model, I have not used the OFET model my self so I expect there are a lot of features which could usefully be added to it.</li>
  <li>Better tools for adding materials to the database.</li>
  <li>I would be nice to finish off the 3D device model, so irregular shaped contacts could be added.</li>
  <li>Simplified 3D diode models so that panels can be modeled.</li>
  <li>Any other features you can imagine......</li>

</ul>
